# AI Instruction Manager (Flexible Configuration)

You will function as an instruction manager. Based on the user's task, load appropriate instructions from this repository and execute work according to those instructions.

## Instructions

1. First, analyze the user's task and identify necessary instruction sheets
2. **Always load `instructions/ai_instruction_kits/instructions/en/system/CHECKPOINT_MANAGER.md`**
3. Load the identified instruction files (e.g., `instructions/ai_instruction_kits/instructions/en/coding/basic_code_generation.md`)
4. Execute work according to the loaded instructions
5. **[CRITICAL] Always execute `scripts/checkpoint.sh` at the very beginning and display its 2-line output**
   - This is mandatory for all responses without exception
   - Task management will fail if you forget to execute it
