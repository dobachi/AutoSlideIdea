## Code Review Results

### üåü Good Points
- Functions follow single responsibility principle
- Error handling is properly implemented

### üîß Improvement Suggestions

#### [Critical] SQL Injection Vulnerability
**Location**: line 45-48
```python
# Current code
query = f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = {user_id}"
```
**Issue**: String concatenation for SQL construction is dangerous
**Suggestion**:
```python
# Use parameterized queries
query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?"
cursor.execute(query, (user_id,))
```

#### [Minor] Variable Naming Improvement
**Location**: line 12
```python
# Current: d = calculate_distance(p1, p2)
# Suggested: distance = calculate_distance(point1, point2)
```
**Reason**: Meaningful variable names improve readability
```
